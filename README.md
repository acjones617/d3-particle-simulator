#javascript-koans

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. This project was worked
on with a pair; it's representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled.

This work was built on top of Mike Bostock's collision detection demo:
